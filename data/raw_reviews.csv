We visited to celebrate my sister’s upcoming wedding, and despite being a party of fourteen (yes, fourteen!), the staff managed to accommodate us with grace and good humor. It was a tight squeeze, but we made it work—and the cozy, charming ambiance helped set the tone for a joyful evening.

We kicked things off with a trio of appetizers: fried Brussels sprouts, nachos, and stuffed ricotta balls. The Brussels sprouts were crisp and well-prepared, though not my personal favorite. The nachos, however, were a standout—easily the best I’ve ever had, with layers of flavor and perfect crunch. The ricotta balls were satisfying, though they could’ve used a touch more seasoning to really shine.

For my main, I had the spinach lasagna. It was generously portioned and hearty, ideal for a chilly evening. That said, I found myself wishing for a bit of salt and pepper—oddly, none was on the table. I also sampled my dad’s black ginger tofu, which was a hit with the rest of the table but tasted a bit bland to me.

Dessert was a delightful assortment of bite-sized treats: vegan chocolate cupcakes (absolutely divine), almond balls, berry crumble, and a coffee-infused square. The cupcakes stole the show—rich, moist, and indulgent without being heavy.

Overall, this is a solid pick for vegetarians and anyone looking for a welcoming, flavorful dining experience. The staff was friendly, the space was cute, and while a few dishes could use a seasoning boost, the highlights more than made up for it. Would definitely recommend, especially for those nachos and cupcakes!",a month ago,

While overall the pricing was fair for the area, The only reason why the review is not 5 stars is because of the pricing on the specials. They had a ribs special that was 4 ribs (about 35-40% of the whole rack) for $33 ($43 with tax and tip) which is just unjustified. These aren't kurobuta heritage ribs that I could tell and good smoking is not an extravagance these days with technology where it is. So seemed excessive for that.

Blue Stone in Evanston is a hidden gem that perfectly balances casual dining with great food and atmosphere. My group visited during a quiet afternoon, and the experience was fantastic from start to finish.

The appetizers here are generous enough to make a meal! We tried the loaded nachos with chicken, which came perfectly assembled with guacamole, sour cream, and salsa (pro tip: follow our server's recommendation to skip the olives). We also ordered the Parmesan Truffle Fries with aioli, which were absolutely addictive – we demolished them in record time.
The service was outstanding, with both the hostess and our server being incredibly welcoming and knowledgeable. Our server's recommendations were spot-on, helping us make the perfect choices for our meal.

The ambiance is versatile and comfortable, with both booth and table seating options and great lighting throughout. There are TVs placed strategically around the restaurant for sports fans, but they don't detract from the overall chill vibe. During warmer months, they offer outdoor seating which creates a wonderful, relaxing atmosphere. Even in cooler weather, the patio can be enjoyable if you dress appropriately.

Pro tips:
The loaded nachos and truffle fries are must-try items
You can upgrade your entrée's side dish to truffle fries
Visit during off-peak hours if you prefer a quieter atmosphere
Consider the outdoor seating in nice weather

Overall, Blue Stone offers a comfortable, casual dining experience with generous portions and attentive service. Definitely worth checking out if you're in Evanston!",10 months ago,

I tried the smoked wings with Alabama sauce and the Knucklepunch with french fries.
The wings had a lightly smokey flavor to the skin and the meat maintained a nice juicyness.  I thought these were highly enjoyable. I ordered them with the house special Alabama Sauce, but I have no idea what the sauce taste profile was, it was white, but I don't even know how to describe it. 7 wings to an order. Wings are close to 5 stars, the sauce is 3 stars.
The Knucklepunch sounded like an absolute behemoth of a sandwich, it didn't quite live up to my expectations. It was too busy of a sandwich. The most notable take away from this sandwich was the pork belly, It waa just 2 thick peppered slices of fat that needed more rendering to be edible. I did think the smash burger had a nice taste and might be good in the right application. This is the sandwich that finally taught me that more is not necessarily better.
The fries here were the high spot. Fresh cut and exactly the type of fry I remember restaurants for having. These were unsalted so if you want them salted you'll have to ask. I could eat a mountain of these and they'd probably be next level awesome with a good white cheese sauce.
I carried my order out after placing my order online and the lady was beyond pleasant and smiled with her every word. I also thought that the restaurant had a nice set up in a nice neighborhood.
For my next visit whenever that might be I plan on either the Poutine or the ATX smash burger. They both look fantastic.
For now, I think 4 stars best describes my grade for Pit and Tap. I liked it, but think theres a real chance that they could bring this rating to a 5 in the future with a strong showing my next time around",4 months ago,

It really had the feel of a small eatery in one of the quieter regions of Japan. Chris the owner wanted to give a realistic experience. His wife who is of Asian descent, also a veteran of the food business, had a huge input on the menu. And, it is a wonderful menu.

I had the teriyaki steak bowl, also the cucumber salad, some hot sake to drink, and, the black bean paste dessert. Very sweet.

My wife, she had the octopus, the cucumber salad, green tea, and a very delicious Japanese guava juice. The facility is very clean, it is small, but they have a large room in the back for karaoke. By the way the bathrooms and the kitchen were extremely clean. That tells you all you need to know about the compassion of the owners. All in all, it was a wonderful experience. It really did remind us of Japan when we went to visit our daughter.

One thing I will mention, they do have a day, Tuesday, where there is an English conversation dinner for all non-native English speaking students going to northwestern. It's like everyone getting together and learning about everyone else. It's a very United Nations type of feel. What a wonderful idea! 🫶",Edited 10 months ago,
